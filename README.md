# Learning-SwiftUI-MusicApp

Application made so that I can learn SwiftUI and quickly hack together a barely passable song transfer application. Initially tried it with `CoreBluetooth` framework but it was too slow. Then added in the `Multipeer Network` feature which was significantly faster. Like almost immediate. So that was an interesting discovery. Multipeer seems to work perfectly between device and simulator but doesn't between mac and device.
